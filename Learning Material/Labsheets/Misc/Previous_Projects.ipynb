We proposed in this research that a fuzzy PID algorithm be implemented to improve the performance of the conventional PID. When the robot is under fuzzy PID control, the yawing ability may vary. The task/environment should be investigated for the limits of its operation for a given set of PID settings and target velocity. Two tests were conducted to assess the fuzzy PID algorithm, and it was determined that fuzzy PID outperformed conventional PID. After that, we proposed maximum velocity threshold prediction to predict the yaw capability of a robot with a given task and fuzzy PID variables. This method was tested by the data recorded during the experiment process."

The Pololu 3pi+ At mega 32U4 has a LIS3MDL 3 axial magnetometer sensor mounted on the robot. Firstly, a baseline solution is suggested for detecting the magnetic object and identifying the angle of the ferro-magnetic objects w.r.t to robot. It is found out that the baseline solution can detect the presence of a magnetic object. However, it is unable to deduce its angular direction. Hence, to extrapolate the angular direction using a magnetometer sensor, an improved solution is proposed. The solution is staged in two parts. The first part locates the optimum stretch at which the sensor detects the magnet with minimum error. The second part investigates the value of the mean standard deviation of the error for that distance. It is discovered that the optimum distance is 5 centimeters from the mobile robot with 2.1 degrees of mean angular deviation.\n"

In order to make the robot better at obstacle avoidance tasks, this report proposes two enhanced composite control methods. After tests, we found that these two methods resulted in the robot performing better in obstacle avoidance of large obstacles."

The robot in front determines its route by using the line sensor to recognize the previously set black belt. This report introduces the background and inspiration of the project design. In the design process, the problem of the impact of the impact sensor on the environment was explored, and the error was reduced by using a variety of algorithms to average. In addition, in order to solve the problem of sliding between the two robots, the shell surface material of the 3pi+ pololu robot was changed to obtain different friction forces, and the maximum motor speed that can complete the task under three different conditions was tested. Try to use EEPROM to store the movement coordinates of the robot below, but due to its small storage space, it can only record a limited amount of data. At the same time, a USB interface is also used to directly read and record enough data. In order to make the experimental results more intuitive, used the kinematics principles to construct the movement trajectories of the leading robot and the follower robot, and obtained the experimental results by comparing the front and back trajectories.\n"

        "# Application of Gyroscope Accelerometer Calibration by Kalman Filter in angle detection\n",
        "Abstract—This report used the Pololu 32U4 3pi+ to deal with measurement errors and noise interference when encountering different angles. The LSM6DS33 is a 3pi+ Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with a gyroscope and accelerometer. By applying this IMU, the user can learn the real-time attitude values of the 3pi+, such as its roll and pitch angles. The values detected by using the IMU directly without processing are inaccurate. In this paper, we assume that using a Kalman filter combined with a gyroscope and accelerometer will give higher accuracy. We combined the accelerometer and gyroscope with the Kalman filter to improve this situation. Using this combination because the accelerometer is sensitive to vibrations and other disturbances, but the state calculated from long-term data is reliable. In contrast, gyroscopes are not sensitive to vibrations but can drift with long-term use. The conclusions show that the application of the Kalman filter confirms that the results obtained with the use of the filter are more accurate than the angular values converted by using only the accelerometer.\n"
