        "This labsheet gives a brief overview of how to use the non-volatile memory on your 3Pi+.  Non-volatile means that you can save data to this memory, turn your 3Pi+ on and off again, and the data should still be saved.   This memory is called `EEPROM`, and we can use an Arduino Library `EEPROM.h` to read and write to it.\n",

        "- The EEPROM is only guaranteed to have 100,000 write cycles.  Please avoid accidentally writing into your EEPROM continuously.\n",
        "- It is possible to use `EEPROM.update()` rather than `EEPROM.write()`.  This only writes to EEPROM if the value has changed.  This will significantly increase the lifespan of the EEPROM memory.\n",
        "- More information on using EEPROM can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/EEPROM\">Arduino Reference</a>."
