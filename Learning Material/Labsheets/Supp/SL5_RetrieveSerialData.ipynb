        "\n",
        "This labsheet will help you to retrieve data from your 3Pi+ robot **after** the end of your experiment.  This should let you run your experiment without the USB cable plugged in.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 3Pi+ has a known issue:\n",
        "- Unplugging the USB cable during the robot operation can cause irratic behaviour, and/or a reset of your robot.\n",
        "- Plugging in the USB cable during the robot operation can cause a reset.\n",
        "\n",
        "This labsheet provides example code of a method to retrieve data via the Serial connection (USB).  You will need to adapt this code to your own needs, following the convention as laid out.\n",

        "**Note:** Your robot will still reset when you finally close the Serial monitor.\n",
        "\n",
        "When using this code and method, it is a good idea to reset your computer.  This will help to ensure that you do not have any existing problems with your USB ports and the Arduino IDE.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may also want to investigate the EEPROM memory in another Supplementary Labsheet, which will allow your robot to store data even when it has been powered off or reset.  Using EEPROM and the push buttons, you can select the mode of your between running an experiment or reporting results."
