As these plastic segments are depressed against the 3Pi+ body, the quantity of reflected light reduces.\n",

        "  - A disadvantage of using IR Light to detect the depression of the bump sensors is that their performance characteristic varies with ambient light. Therefore, it will likely be necessary to write a calibration routine to make robust autonomous decisions from the bump sensors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **To Detect Ambient Light Measurements**:\n",
        " - A disadvantage of using the bump sensors to detect ambient light levels is that dark regions may take up to 14ms to conduct a reading, which is a relatively long time for our probable `tasks`.\n",
        " - An interesting advantage of detecting ambient levels whilst the IR Light emitters are activated is that the overall read time remains relatively quick (when the bumpers are not depressed), but variation in the ambient light condition is still evidenced.\n"
