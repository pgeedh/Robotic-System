For our small robot, rapid changes to wheel speed are likely to cause the wheels to slip on the surface.  From the last labsheet, we have been using the rotation of the wheels to estimate the robots `pose` (position and rotation).  Therefore, if the wheels slip on the surface, there will be encoder counts but the robot will not change it's `pose` in reality.  Within the line following challenge, wheel slip will severely effect the ability for your robot to complete the final objective, `return to home`.  \n",

Therefore, it is desirable for our heading to change in a continuous manner (not sudden), just as it is desirable for wheel speed to change in a continuous manner.  \n",

        "The D-term will essentially be subtractive to your feedback signal (and thus, the P-term and I-term combined), and the two can quickly interact to form unstable oscillations.  Therefore, D-term should be used to mitigate infrequent and high magnitude \"shocks\" to the system, such as sudden changes of demand.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Because the D-term is generally regarded as a dampening mechanism, it is often approached to remove all variation/noise in the feedback signal.  **This is not a recommended use of the D-term**.  This is because, to make the D-term effective in removing normal and persistent small noise from your feedback signal, you would need to set a very large gain for your D-term.  Consequently, for a less frequent, but higher magnitude sudden change to input or load, this high gain value would cause an extreme D-term response, and likely cause a complete control failure.  Therefore, we should expect a relatively small gain for the D-term, and for it to be effective only in infrequent events.\n",

At $t_{1}$, the sudden change to positive causes a very large error - note, here the error is equal to double the positive demand value, because we are moving from a negative value to positive.  The illustration shows that from a stable state where the error signal was previously 0, the P-term (green line) will provide large feedback, causing dramatic overshoot.  Assuming this is a PI-controller, the I-term (not shown) would bring the system to demand, allowing the P-term to return to 0.  However, at $t_{2}$, the demand goes negative, and the same but inverse response is shown.\n",

Under such a large change of the error signal, a small D-term `gain` $K_{d}$ would be effective.  With the same value of $K_{d}$ under the normal small variation of error signal, the D-term would be negligible.  This is fine - it is desirable that your system needs as little dampening as possible.\n",

It is hard for the robot to know whether it has lost the line in an ordinary sense, or finished the complete line.  It is important to consider what information is accessible to the robot, and which of these will make the most robust behaviour.\n",
        "  - In robotics, we will often face a dilemma of how much specialist domain knowledge (e.g., human knowledge) to program into a solution.  It is preferable (in the spirit of automation) if the robot can be as general and as autonomously adaptable as possible.  \n",

        "- **Help:** Going Home has several features which can make it challenging to debug.  Most of all, it occurs at the end of your line following routine.  You will be able to debug your code quicker if you can start your program at a system `state` just prior to Go Home.  Time spent watching your robot operate (e.g. solving line following again and again) adds up quickly.  \n",
        "  - The Go Home element has a lot of trigonometry involved, and it can be useful to draw it out.\n",
        "  - The Go Home element is a lot like line following, except you will be following information derived from your kinematics.\n",
        "  - Getting good performance from the Go Home element can have a lot to do with a good calibration of your kinematic model.\n",

        "- **Help:** A concept not introduced in the labsheets is called a `watchdog timer`.  A watchdog timer is a mechanism which monitors the passage of time, and then creates an event if a threshold is crossed.  This is similar to the `timeout` fuctionality we used for the Line Sensors.  You can implement a watchdog timer using either `millis()` or `micros()`, or if your program has good flow control, you can use a variable to count up or down with each iteration.  \n",
