By using a last-known position and a subsequent measurement of change, it is possible to calculate an estimate of the robot position.  This technique is known as **`dead reckoning`**.\n",

Some rotary coders are `absolute`, meaning they can be read to know the exact rotation of the device they are attached to.  Other encoders are `incremental`, meaning that when read they only indicate a change in rotation.  It is also possible to get position encoders which measure linear travel, rather than rotation.  \n",

        "- **`polling`**: if a device is polled, it means the device is read at regular time intervals.  This would mean the encoder is read whether or not there was any rotation.  It is important that the read operation happens sufficiently frequently or many rotations may happen (and be missed) within the time interval.  The `polling` technique will be demonstrated and discussed as insufficient in one of the unit lectures.\n",
        "- **`interrupt-driven`**: in an interrupt driven subsystem the host computer can set peripheral hardware to monitor for a change.  When a change occurs, an `interrupt` flag (request) is set, and an `interrupt service routine` (ISR) within the microcontroller is required to handle the information within an appropriate time frame.\n",

We have used the assumption that an encoder `interrupt service routine` (ISR) will activate when the wheel is moved.  This is achieved on the 3Pi+ by using a **`Pin Change Interrupt`**.  \n",

        "**`Pin Change Interrupts`** are a special piece of hardware.  Microcontrollers have many useful built-in peripherals.  A pin change interrupt watches a specific pin on the chip for a change of state (low to high, or high to low).  When the microcontroller detects a change, it can be set to automatically run a piece of code.  The piece of code which runs automatically is called an **`Interrupt Service Routine`** (ISR).  An ISR is not exclusively for pin changes - they can be triggered to run by many peripherals, taking input internal or external to the microcontroller.  \n",
        "\n",
        "An `interrupt` is so called because it will pause sequence of your main code.  These are especially useful to catch external events, rather than inefficiently `polling` to detect them.  However, most microcontrollers have only one central processing unit (CPU, often called a 'core').  Therefore, because your code within `loop()` runs on the only CPU inside the 32u4, it will be paused to run an ISR instead.  \n",
        "\n",
        "You can think of an ISR as being a background task which runs \"only when it needs to\".  However, you are responsible for determining the cause of the interrupt (what triggers it), and the efficiency of the ISR (how much CPU time it will use).  \n",

        "\n",
        "If you are experimenting with an ISR and your robot starts to behave in a strange way, you may have made your ISR too big (or more seriously, have a bug within the ISR code).  Note that, using ISR's means the execution of your code is no longer `deterministic` - the compiler cannot predict when an ISR will activate, and neither can you.  For example, we cannot know when a wheel and motor will rotate.  \n",

        "Obviously, a Pin Change Interrupt is very convenient for watching the state of the encoders.  We can consider catching encoder changes to be a high priority, perhaps higher than our main program.

Typically, encoders refer to this property as **Count Per Revolution (CPR)**, **Pulses Per Revolution (PPR)** or **Lines Per Revolution (LPR)**.  The higher the CPR, the more precisely  rotation can be determined. This is because we are essentially dividing a full rotation (360 degrees, or 2\\*PI radians) by the CPR.  One thing that will effect this, is whether the encoder is placed before or after any gearing on the motor.  It may be that a full rotation of the encoder is only a fraction of a full rotation of the wheel.

        "**For the line following challenge, the simple kinematic model provided is sufficient to enable your robot to travel back to where it started with reasonable performance.  The exercises in this section can be considered optional or suitable for further work.**  \n",
        "\n",
        "In the simple model detailed in this labsheet, we have worked with the assumption that the robot will move or rotate, exclusively (either one or the other). As such, our model translates by some amount $X_{R}$ and then rotates this translation motion by some $\\theta_{R}$.  These operations are accounted for by the following motor activations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- when left and right motors have equal non-zero velocity and in the same direction, $v_{l} = v_{r} \\ne 0$, the robot will move forwards or backwards in a straight line.\n",
        "- when the left and right motors have equal non-zero and inversed velocity, $v_{l} = -v_{r} \\ne 0$, the robot will rotate on the spot.\n",
        "\n",
        "This presents the exceptional case when the left and right motor are of different velocity, including cases where one my be 0.  Under these conditions, the robot will move on an arc.\n",
        "\n",

        "When the wheels have differing velocity, the point of rotation for the movement moves away from point $p$.  This new point of rotation is referred to as the `instantaneous centre of rotation` (ICR).  The more similar the wheels speeds, the further the ICR moves from point $p$.\n",

        "  - **Hypothesise:** If the ICR moves away from point $p$, and so defines an arc of travel for the robot, will the simplified model under-estimate or over-estimate the resultant position in comparison?\n",

        "  - Any gain in performance from this implementation is likely to be more pronounced and visible when you address the full line following challenge, especially the return to home objective.  Therefore, you may need to return to this exercise later.  \n",
