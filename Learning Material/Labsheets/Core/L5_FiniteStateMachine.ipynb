The general layout and design of your code can quite messy and complicated.  This is quite normal in a development cycle, but it can be a major cause of time spent solving bugs.  It is good practice to consolidate your code and to reduce functional repetition.  \n",

When this is achieved, it is then much easier to enable or disable behaviours, to change the mechanisms to start or end behaviours, or to change the sequential transitions between behaviours.\n",

        "\n",
        "- _\"A finite-state machine (FSM) ... is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.\"_\n",
        "\n",
        "The following example, also from Wikipedia, will also help us to understand how to implement a FSM for our robot.\n",
        "\n",
        "An example of a simple mechanism that can be modeled by a state machine is a turnstile.\n",
        "\n",
        "A turnstile, used to control access to subways and amusement park rides, is a gate with three rotating arms at waist height, one across the entryway. Initially the arms are locked, blocking the entry, preventing patrons from passing through. Depositing a coin or token in a slot on the turnstile unlocks the arms, allowing a single customer to push through. After the customer passes through, the arms are locked again until another coin is inserted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considered as a state machine, the turnstile has **two possible states: Locked and Unlocked**. There are **two possible inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot (coin) and pushing the arm (push)**. In the locked state, pushing on the arm has no effect; no matter how many times the input push is given, it stays in the locked state. Putting a coin in – that is, giving the machine a coin input – shifts the state from Locked to Unlocked. In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional coin inputs does not change the state. However, a customer pushing through the arms, giving a push input, shifts the state back to Locked.\n",
        "\n",
        "The turnstile state machine can be represented by a state transition table, showing for each possible state, the transitions between them (based upon the inputs given to the machine) and the outputs resulting from each input:\n",

        "Building a FSM can become very complicated.  It is best to get something simple working first. To start with, we will design a FSM to get our robot to drive forward from the starting box on the map, and then stop when it finds the line.  \n",
        "\n",
        "When designing an FSM, we need to step away from our human understanding of how the robot should behave (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism\">anthropomorphism</a>).  Instead, it is better to attempt to anticipate how the code you have written will operate.\n",
        "\n",
        "We need to decompose the desired overall behaviour into smaller behaviours which rely only on the information available to the robot.  We need to make sure we catch any assumptions about the robot, any ambiguity, and any potentially ambiguous circumstances.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, what should your robot do as soon as you turn it on?  The robot is fundamentally not-intelligent, so we need to embed our intelligence into the robot with code.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our case, it would be useful if, when we turn on the robot, it makes sure:\n",
        "1. all motors are off so it doesn't run away.\n",
        "2. it signals to you (light or sound) for some time so you know it is safe to to locate the robot on the surface.\n",
        "3. it then performs any calibration protocols from a safe starting position.\n",
        "4. it returns actuators and sensors to a known initial state, and outputs a final output signal to you (light or sound) to indicate it is ready.\n",
        "\n",
        "This short behaviour would operate within our **initial state**.  After this, the robot would need to `transition` into a new state of operation, employing further behaviours.\n",
        "\n",
        "To start developing a FSM, we will work on moving between **3 states**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. An **initial** state: the sequence outlined above.  \n",
        "2. A **drive forwards** state: to drive out of the starting box, and attempt to encounter the line, or otherwise `time out` the operation and signal an error.  \n",
        "3. A **found line** state: to get the robot to stop when it finds the line, and to signal this success.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a good start to a FSM.  Hopefully you are already imagining how it could be extended.  To start, we can check that the robot is able to reliably move between just these three states appropriately.  Once this is complete, we can start to add further states to employ the appropriate functional behaviours.  \n",
